# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn in a bank using machine learning techniques. Churn refers to customers who leave (or stop using) a service. By analyzing customer behavior and demographic data, we build models to identify which customers are likely to churn ‚Äî helping banks take proactive action to retain them.

# Problem Statement :
The problem to be investigated in this study is the analysis of the Bank customer churn history with respect to different features available in dataset. 
The main objectives of this project are To develop customer churn predictive model using supervised machine learning classifiers algorithms; To use the model to predict the potential churners and non-churners; To evaluate and compare the performance of the model based on Accuracy.
